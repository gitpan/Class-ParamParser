	* Release 1.0.

	* This release contains my "Class::ParamParser" module which was previously a
part of my "libdwg" distribution, but I have set it off on its own for those of
you who only want to use this and not the other modules.

	* This module contains complete POD within it.
	
	* This module requires Perl version 5.004 (although 5.0 may work).
