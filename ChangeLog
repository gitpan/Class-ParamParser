	* Release 1.02.
	
	* This release is the first one that includes the CPAN standard files 
	"MakeFile.pl", "Test.pl", and "Manifest", which were all created following 
	the previous release.  "Test.pl" was used to discover several bugs that my 
	production use of the modules didn't; their fixes are detailed below.
	The content of "Manifest" was previously inside the "ReadMe" file.
	
	* Added a third method, params_to_hash_or_array(), which is now used to 
	implement both of the existing methods; this eliminates an 80% redundancy in 
	their code.  The first argument of the new method says which of the original 
	two, params_to_hash() or params_to_array(), it acts like.
	
	* Added a sixth argument to all methods, which lowercases (makes 
	case-insensitive) named source parameters when true, for easier matching.
	
	* Added programmer documentation to the various blocks of code, so it is 
	easier to see how they work; useful because a lot is done with little code.
	
	* Fixed bug where RENAME failed to match parameters for renaming to "", 
	which is the explicit signal to delete them.
	
	* Any SOURCE that has an odd number of elements will now be interpreted as 
	positional format; previously, SOURCE needed to have exactly one element for 
	this to happen.  As before, tests for named format have higher precedence, 
	so a SOURCE whose first element is either a hash or starts with a "-" is 
	considered named regardless of the number of elements in SOURCE.  This 
	change fixed a bug causing an "Odd number of elements in hash list" warning 
	when an odd number of SOURCE elements was interpreted as named format; 
	however, that warning will still appear with an odd list starting with "-".

	* If there are multiple "remaining" values in SOURCE, they are now all 
	returned rather than just the first one.  See the parameter documentation 
	for REM for details.  This means that previously ignored second and third 
	"remaining" values will cause the return value for REM to be an array ref 
	instead of a scalar, so your code may have to check for this.

	* Fixed bug where NAMES defaulted to a single value of "" when it should 
	have defaulted to an empty list; this had resulted in params_to_array() 
	always returning a value when it should have returned none.

	* Fixed bug occurring when we make positional output from an empty 
	SOURCE whereby the output is an array containing "undef" values; the 
	count of these values was the same as the number of values in NAMES; 
	now the returned array is empty as it should be.

	* Release 1.01.
	
	* This release is the first one following official registrations with 
	"The Perl 5 Module List".  The updated entry would look like this:
	
Class::
::ParamParser     bdpO Provides complex parameter list parsing      DUNCAND
	
	* Module POD has been significantly updated, particularly in the Synopsis 
	section, and the ReadMe file was overhauled.
	
	* There were no changes to the code itself.

2000-08-26   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

	* Release 1.0.

	* This release contains my "Class::ParamParser" module which was previously a
part of my "libdwg" distribution, but I have set it off on its own for those of
you who only want to use this and not the other modules.

	* This module contains complete POD within it.
	
	* This module requires Perl version 5.004.
	
2000-08-23   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

	* libdwg 1.11, the last version of the distribution to include
Class::ParamParser, was released.
	
2000-07-23   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

	* libdwg 1.0, the first version of any distribution to include
Class::ParamParser, was released on CPAN.
	
2000-04-21   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

	* Completed primary development on this module.

2000-01-30   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

	* Began development on the final version of this module.
	
	* Module based on a template created by h2xs 1.18.

1999-07-29 thru 1999-11-13

	* Worked on prototype of code that ended up in this module.
